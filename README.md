# React Job Portal

This is a **CRUD Job Portal application** built using **React** and a **mock API**. It allows users to view, add, update, and delete job listings. The UI is responsive and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and the app provides success messages using **React Toastify** and includes a custom **404 Page** for invalid routes.
